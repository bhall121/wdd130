    <h2>Branson Hall</h2>
    <p>My name is Branson and I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in software development because I love working with tech and building great software programs from scratch. I enjoy spending time with my family, learning, solving complex problems, and being in nature.</p>
    <p>I hope to begin my career in the software industry by the time I get my first certification in Web and Computer Programming. Right now, I am just working an entry-level job to provide for my family and school.</p>
    <p>The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is how the instructors always share the course material in a gospel-centered manner. I love the Lord and am so grateful to have been raised by righteous, covenant keeping parents.</p>

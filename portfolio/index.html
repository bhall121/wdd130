                <h1>Branson Hall</h1>
                <p><b>Who am I?</b> - I am Branson Hall. I'm an aspiring software engineer. 
                    When I began learning to read and write code at the beginning of this 
                    year, it didn't take long before I fell in love. I enjoy building great 
                    software programs from scratch, especially if it will push me to expand 
                    my knowledge and skillset. I'm attending college to learn more about 
                    software and better understand computers.</p>

                <p><b>What do I do?</b> - My main focus lately has been learning to build 
                    websites. I'm starting to understand and implement some basic methods
                     of formatting elements with CSS to make a website look appealing and 
                     still be functional and intuitive. When I'm not learning to develop 
                     software, you can find me hanging out with my family, playing 
                     basketball, hiking, or reading a good book.</p>

                <p><b>Who am I?</b> - I am Branson Hall. I'm an aspiring software engineer. When I began learning to read and write code at the beginning of this year, it didn't take long before I fell in love. I enjoy building great software programs from scratch, especially if it will push me to expand my knowledge and skillset. I'm attending college to learn more about software and better understand computers.</p>

                <p><b>What do I do?</b> - My main focus lately has been learning to build websites. I'm starting to understand and implement some basic methods of formatting elements with CSS to make a website look appealing and still be functional and intuitive. When I'm not learning to develop software, you can find me hanging out with my wife and toddler son, playing basketball, hiking, or reading a good book.</p>

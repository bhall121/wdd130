                <p><b>Python</b> - I have been writing Python programs since January of this year, and I have loved every minute of it. I've built dozens of programs in Python and have learned a lot! I've recently learned how to use functions and variables to make my code as easy to reuse and edit as possible. Dictionaries are a new tool that I am currently learning to use to be more efficient in the process of retrieving values when compared to lists.</p>

                <p><b>HTML/CSS</b> - Building websites is still a new concept to me as I have only been using HTML and CSS since April of this year. However, I have still learned a lot in this time. I recently learned how to use grid templates to format elements and this has opened a whole new world to me. This concept has sparked a new sense of excitement in me for developing websites that wasn't there before. I had a hard time enjoying building websites before this because my projects didn't look appealing to me. I feel that the world is at my fingertips now that I can inject more of my creativity into my websites through grid templates.</p>

                <p><b>Leadership</b> - I believe that complacency is the enemy of growth and innovation. This belief has shaped a lot of the decisions that I have made in my life. It's the reason that I always strive to leave a positive impact in everything that I do. Even when I don't hold a formal leadership title, I always strive to be a leader to those around me to inspire hope in my peers and spark a culture of improvement in all things.

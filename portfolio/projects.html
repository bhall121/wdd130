                    <p>This project is currently a work in progress aside from the home page of the website which is fully complete. This project is particularly special to me because it is the first website that I have built in conjunction with CSS. It took a lot of studying for me to figure out how to format the website in the way that I wanted it but it has been gratifying to see how all of my hard work came together.</p>
                    <a href="https://bhall121.github.io/wdd130/portfolio/index.html"><b>Personal Portfolio</b></a>
                    <p>This website you are viewing now is my latest project. I am thrilled to see how much I have improved at building websites when I compare this site to others that I have worked on! It will always be a work in progress as I update this site to reflect the new skills that I will continue to learn on my coding journey.</p>

                    <p>This is a project that I worked on using Python and it is my latest experience using dictionaries. It took some problem-solving to figure out how to access both of the dictionaries in this project while in a for loop.</p>
                    <a href="downloads/adventure_game.py" download><b>Adventure Game</b></a>
                    <p>My Python adventure game is a text-based game that gives the user multiple choices for actions they can take in response to a scenario that they are presented with. Every choice they make will deliver a unique follow-up scenario and more choices. This project was one that I had a lot of fun writing because it allowed me to be creative and create fun, unexpected consequences for the decisions that the user would take.</p>

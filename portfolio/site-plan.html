      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This website will be a personal portfolio website that is intended to 
        showcase projects that I have worked on and my abilities as a developer.
        Others can use my website to get to know me better as a developer.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My website will target an audience of future potential employers. They 
        are looking to learn more about my abilities as a developer to find out 
        if I would fit well with their team and aspirations. They will mostly 
        access my website via laptop or desktop computer because they will likely 
        be reviewing several portfolio websites at once while working at the 
        office.

        <b>Who am I?</b> - My name is Branson Hall. I am an aspiring software engineer. 
        When I began learning to read and write code at the beginning of this year,
         it didn’t take long before I fell in love. I enjoy manipulating computers 
         to do my will. I’m attending college to learn more about software and 
         better understand computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What do I do?</b> - My main focus lately has been learning to build websites. 
        I’m starting to understand and implement some basic methods of formatting 
        elements with CSS to make a website look appealing and still be functional 
        and intuitive. When I’m not learning to develop software, you can find me 
        hanging out with my wife and toddler son, playing street basketball, hiking, 
        or reading a good book.

      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Python</b> - I have been writing Python programs since January of this 
        year, and I have loved every minute of it. I’ve built dozens of programs 
        in Python and have learned a lot! I’ve recently learned how to use 
        functions and variables to make my code as easy to reuse and edit as 
        possible. Dictionaries are a new tool that I am currently learning to use 
        to be more efficient in the process of retrieving values when compared to 
        lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>HTML/CSS</b> - Building websites is still a new concept to me as I have 
        only been using HTML and CSS since April of this year. However, I have 
        still learned a lot in this time. I recently learned how to use grid 
        templates to format elements and this has opened a whole new world to me. 
        This concept has sparked a new sense of excitement in me for developing 
        websites that wasn’t there before. I had a hard time enjoying building 
        websites before this because my projects didn’t look appealing to me. I 
        feel that the world is at my fingertips now that I can inject more of my 
        creativity into my websites through grid templates.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Leadership</b> - I believe that complacency is the enemy of growth and 
        innovation. This belief has shaped a lot of the decisions that I have 
        made in my life. It’s the reason that I always strive to leave a positive 
        impact in everything that I do. Even when I don’t hold a formal 
        leadership title, I always strive to be a leader to those around me to 
        inspire hope in my peers and spark a culture of improvement in all things.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Whitewater Rafting Website</b> - This project is currently a work in 
        progress aside from the home page of the website which is fully complete. 
        This project is one that is particularly special to me because it is the 
        first website that I have built in conjunction with CSS. It took a lot of 
        studying for me to figure out how to format the website in the way that I 
        wanted it but it has been gratifying to see how all of my hard work came 
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Family History</b> - This is a project that I worked on using Python 
        and it is my latest experience using dictionaries. It took some 
        problem-solving to figure out how to access both of the dictionaries in 
        this project while in a for loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Adventure Game</b> - My Python adventure game is a text-based game that 
        gives the user multiple choices for actions they can take in response to a 
        scenario that they are presented with. Every choice they make will deliver 
        a unique follow-up scenario and more choices. This project was one that I 
        had a lot of fun writing because it allowed me to be creative and create 
        fun, unexpected consequences for the decisions that the user would take.
